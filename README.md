# music- End-to-end deep generation model
This project mainly use a conditional-GAN model to generate melody based on input lyrics.
The original datasets and source codes are from https://github.com/yy1lab/Lyrics-Conditioned-Neural-Melody-Generation
I optimized the structure of the model, and improved the performance finally.
For the evaluation metries- MMD scores, I reserved the experimetns results of four MMD metries - MMD overall, pitch, duration, rest.
